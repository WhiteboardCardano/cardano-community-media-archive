# Cardano Community Media Archive

The **Cardano Community Media Archive** is an open-source preservation project
dedicated to storing, documenting, and sharing all multimedia design assets
created for major Cardano ecosystem events.

This includes raw production files, design elements, motion graphics, stage
visuals, video source files, templates, and supporting documentation used for:

- **Vietnam Cardano Summit 2022**
- **Vietnam Cardano Summit 2023**
- **Vietnam Cardano Summit 2024**
- **Vietnam Cardano Constitutional Convention**
- **Vietnam Catalyst Working Group 2024**
- **Vietnam Cardano Meetup 2024**
- *(More events may be added over time)*

Our mission is to ensure that these creative works remain accessible,
educational, and reusable for the Cardano community — today and in the future.
